# Extensive-Survey-Camp
# Public-Health-Project
The main aim and purpose of this project was to design a water supply system to each house in a small town with appropriate position for an overhead tank and also to design a sewage extraction system to collect sewage from each house and dump into a sewage treatment plant situated at a specific position.

For this we did a reconnaissance survey of the whole town and created a rough drawing of it depicting all the features such as houses, temples, shops and all other places where water supply and sewage extraction is necessary, then we placed our total station at a place, took the first reference point as the backsight and started our project by taking longitudinal sections at an interval of 15 meters and cross section at an interaval of every 30 meters on every road of the town whether being finished or gravel road.

Then at two positions block levelling was done(one at a point of approximately highest elevation and one at the lowest) to fix the positions of Overhead tank and Sewage treatment plant. By all this, field work completes. In office data from TS is tranferred to computer and then imported to AutoCAD and an aligned drawing is created showing all the houses, shops and temples and then from each house sewage extraction lines and to each house fresh water supplu lines are drawn. Diameter of pipes for both water supply and sewage extraction are decided and further ovrhead tank capacity, specific height required for easy water flow to whole town under the influence of gravitational force is estimated and then implemented into the project and by this office work ends.


# New-Canal-Project
For the new tank project we did earlier now we have to design a canal for the water discharge from the upstream of the natural water tank. So this project included different calculations such as depth of the canal, earthwork required for cutting the canal into the terrain, side slope calculation using Lacey's theory, deciding whether the canal should be lined or unlined depending on the velocity of flowing water and the soil characteristics.

In the feild, alignment of the canal is fixed and at the interval of every 15 meter longitudinal section is taken and at every 30 meter interval cross sections are taken. Then all these points are saved in total station and transferred carefully into the computer. Then the points are imported to AutoCAD and alignment and other reqired drawings are made with the help of SWDTM software.

At the surplus weir the canal was praposed and we decided to design a trapezoidal canal because it's the most economic canal cros section. By using Lacey's theory, canal depth and side slopes are fixed and in AutoCAD in the cross sectional drawings single line sketch of cross section of the canal is created and copied to all the cross sectional drawings and then the volume of earthwork in cutting is calculated, then further cost estimation is done.


# Proposed-allignment-for-a-New-Earthen-Bund
Our aim for this project was to prepare a new allignment of an earthen bund for a natural water tank or reservoir, which was dry at that time. Firstly, main task was to fix the starting and ending points of the bund, for this we decided two points in a terrain having highest elevation by the help of reconnaissance surveying. Then from the starting point we took readings at every 15 meter distance in an approximate straight line and at every 30 meter distance 6 cross sections are taken with 5 meter appart.

At the lowest elevation and high elevation required block leveling is done to fix the sluice and surplus weir positions and to fix the dead storage level as well. Then with the known highest elevation or the elevation of the surplus/waste weir we found out around 40-45 points on the upstream side of the praposed bund to plot a contour of the elevation and to calculate the capacity or the volume of the earthen tank and further to calculate the catchment area.

Then after all the field work was done, points were saved in the total station and then transferred to the computer and then the office work starts. Points are imported to AutoCAD and alignment is drawn and according to that longitudinal and cross sectional drawings are created and in addition the capacity contour is also drawn and using region command watershed area is calculated and then multiplying it with the elevation of contour volume of earthen bund is calculated.

Simillarly, cross section of the bund are drawn in all the cross section drawings and volume of earthwork required to fill is calculated using excel sheets.


# Restoration-of-deteriorated-earthen-bund
Used total station, prism or an object to focus on, measuring tape and with all this some steel pegs. With the help of total station and the prism we found out the center line alignment of the detoriated bund with the help of required number of station changes and backsighting. From the refernece or the starting point we took relative levels at every 15 meter interval and at every 30 meter interval atleast 6 cross sections were taken 3 on each side with 5 meter spacing between them.

Like this a total of 250-300 points are collected with the help of the total station and all the data is carefully saved in the TS and noted manually. Total station postion was changed multiple times in this project and carefully following the process change of position was done. This completes our field work.

Moving to our office work, the data from the total station is transferred to the computer having SWDTM software. Importing all the points into AutoCAD using MS Excel and SWDTM and in AutoCAD the alignment is drawn and Longitudinal drawings and Cross sectional drawings are createrd using specific commands in SWDTM. Cross section shows the detoriated bund levels and we know the elevation of the existing bund so drawing the existing bund line in the AutoCAD in all the cross sectionaldrawings using the elevation, and keeping the slope of 2V:1H on the upstream side and 1.5V:1H on the downstream side, we can find out the volume of earthwork required for the restoration and cost estimation can be further done.
