# Extensive-Survey-Camp
# Public-Health-Project
The main aim and purpose of this project was to design a water supply system to each house in a small town with appropriate position for an overhead tank and also to design a sewage extraction system to collect sewage from each house and dump into a sewage treatment plant situated at a specific position.

For this we did a reconnaissance survey of the whole town and created a rough drawing of it depicting all the features such as houses, temples, shops and all other places where water supply and sewage extraction is necessary, then we placed our total station at a place, took the first reference point as the backsight and started our project by taking longitudinal sections at an interval of 15 meters and cross section at an interaval of every 30 meters on every road of the town whether being finished or gravel road.

Then at two positions block levelling was done(one at a point of approximately highest elevation and one at the lowest) to fix the positions of Overhead tank and Sewage treatment plant. By all this, field work completes. In office data from TS is tranferred to computer and then imported to AutoCAD and an aligned drawing is created showing all the houses, shops and temples and then from each house sewage extraction lines and to each house fresh water supplu lines are drawn. Diameter of pipes for both water supply and sewage extraction are decided and further ovrhead tank capacity, specific height required for easy water flow to whole town under the influence of gravitational force is estimated and then implemented into the project and by this office work ends.


# New-Canal-Project
For the new tank project we did earlier now we have to design a canal for the water discharge from the upstream of the natural water tank. So this project included different calculations such as depth of the canal, earthwork required for cutting the canal into the terrain, side slope calculation using Lacey's theory, deciding whether the canal should be lined or unlined depending on the velocity of flowing water and the soil characteristics.

In the feild, alignment of the canal is fixed and at the interval of every 15 meter longitudinal section is taken and at every 30 meter interval cross sections are taken. Then all these points are saved in total station and transferred carefully into the computer. Then the points are imported to AutoCAD and alignment and other reqired drawings are made with the help of SWDTM software.

At the surplus weir the canal was praposed and we decided to design a trapezoidal canal because it's the most economic canal cros section. By using Lacey's theory, canal depth and side slopes are fixed and in AutoCAD in the cross sectional drawings single line sketch of cross section of the canal is created and copied to all the cross sectional drawings and then the volume of earthwork in cutting is calculated, then further cost estimation is done.
