# Extensive-Survey-Camp
# Public-Health-Project
The main aim and purpose of this project was to design a water supply system to each house in a small town with appropriate position for an overhead tank and also to design a sewage extraction system to collect sewage from each house and dump into a sewage treatment plant situated at a specific position.

For this we did a reconnaissance survey of the whole town and created a rough drawing of it depicting all the features such as houses, temples, shops and all other places where water supply and sewage extraction is necessary, then we placed our total station at a place, took the first reference point as the backsight and started our project by taking longitudinal sections at an interval of 15 meters and cross section at an interaval of every 30 meters on every road of the town whether being finished or gravel road.

Then at two positions block levelling was done(one at a point of approximately highest elevation and one at the lowest) to fix the positions of Overhead tank and Sewage treatment plant. By all this, field work completes. In office data from TS is tranferred to computer and then imported to AutoCAD and an aligned drawing is created showing all the houses, shops and temples and then from each house sewage extraction lines and to each house fresh water supplu lines are drawn. Diameter of pipes for both water supply and sewage extraction are decided and further ovrhead tank capacity, specific height required for easy water flow to whole town under the influence of gravitational force is estimated and then implemented into the project and by this office work ends.
